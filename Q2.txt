Write a blog about objects and its internal representation in Javascript ?

    object is a collection of properties.

    JavaScript objects can have properties, which define their characteristics.

    object initializer is used to create a new object in javascript.

    const myCar = {
        brand: "Ford",
        model: "Mustang",
        year: 1969,
    };

    in above example, myCar is an object.it have some properties like  brand,model,year.

function Car(make, model, year) {
  this.make = make;
  this.model = model;
  this.year = year;
}

inside of the constructor we use this keyword.then new keyword is used to create a new object.

const myCar = new Car("ford", "Talon TSi", 1993);

Inheritance
All objects in JavaScript inherit from at least one other object

A method is a function associated with an object
